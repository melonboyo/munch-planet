ON_SNAKE_CAUGHT_1,"What?? You've caught Snake"
ON_SNAKE_CAUGHT_2,"At least you didn't catch a Dipshit"
ON_SNAKE_CAUGHT_3,"Their shape is tubular, and that's radical"
ON_SNAKE_CAUGHT_4,"As in, they can squeeze through tiny snake-shaped holes"
ON_SNAKE_CAUGHT_5,"Since they're... tubular"
ON_SNAKE_CAUGHT_6,"That's tube die for"
