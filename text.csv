DIPSHIT_3,"Oh look, it's a Dipshit"
DIPSHIT_4,"How 'bout you go over there and try catching it"
DIPSHIT_5,"Don't worry too much about failing"
DIPSHIT_6,"Dipshits don't move much so you can keep trying until you succeed"
DIPSHIT_7,"Use left click on your mouse when you're near him to start"

DIPSHIT_KIDNAPPED_1,"Too bad"
DIPSHIT_KIDNAPPED_2,"I have confiscated your Dipshit due to its incompetency"
DIPSHIT_KIDNAPPED_3,"Using what I've taught you,"
DIPSHIT_KIDNAPPED_4,"I trust in you to find yourself a more comendable Munchme"
DIPSHIT_KIDNAPPED_5,"Bye for now"

ON_SOLIDUDE_CAUGHT_1,"Solidude died"
ON_SOLIDUDE_CAUGHT_2,"Yet somehow their spirit is now in your possession"
ON_SOLIDUDE_CAUGHT_3,"Solidude can barely move, but just one hop..."
ON_SOLIDUDE_CAUGHT_4,"Followed by another hop..."
ON_SOLIDUDE_CAUGHT_5,"And their stony mass will prove itself worthy"
ON_SOLIDUDE_CAUGHT_6,"Now you better hop to it"

ON_GOBY_CAUGHT_1,"Look at this little Goby"
ON_GOBY_CAUGHT_2,"They can sprint really fast"
ON_GOBY_CAUGHT_3,"Steep slopes will be no match for this guy!"
ON_GOBY_CAUGHT_4,"Try running them up that hill over there"
ON_GOBY_CAUGHT_5,"..."
ON_GOBY_CAUGHT_6,"Haha, there is no hill"
ON_GOBY_CAUGHT_7,"I was just messing with you"
ON_GOBY_CAUGHT_8,"That's hillarious"

ON_SNAKE_CAUGHT_1,"What?? You've caught Snake"
ON_SNAKE_CAUGHT_2,"I didn't even see that guy!"
ON_SNAKE_CAUGHT_3,"Their shape is tubular, and that's radical"
ON_SNAKE_CAUGHT_4,"As in, they can squeeze through tiny snake-shaped holes"
ON_SNAKE_CAUGHT_5,"Since they're... tubular"
ON_SNAKE_CAUGHT_6,"That's tube die for"

ON_DIPSHIT_CAUGHT_1,"Another Dipshit?"
ON_DIPSHIT_CAUGHT_2,"These guys are everywhere"
ON_DIPSHIT_CAUGHT_3,"But often overlooked by Munchers due to their simple nature"
ON_DIPSHIT_CAUGHT_4,"You could say they're a bit of a dipshit"

ON_OVERVIEW_DIPSHIT_AREA_1,"That Dipshit is in a cage"
ON_OVERVIEW_DIPSHIT_AREA_2,"Maybe you can break it open"
ON_OVERVIEW_DIPSHIT_AREA_3,"If you really want to catch a Dipshit again"

ON_OVERVIEW_GUNGUN_AREA_1,"Umm"
ON_OVERVIEW_GUNGUN_AREA_2,"That's a sturdy looking rock"
ON_OVERVIEW_GUNGUN_AREA_3,"But maybe he will move..."

ON_OVERVIEW_TORPEJO_AREA_1,"Oh my God."
ON_OVERVIEW_TORPEJO_AREA_2,"That's Torpejo"
ON_OVERVIEW_TORPEJO_AREA_3,"The leader of the Munchers' Guild"
ON_OVERVIEW_TORPEJO_AREA_4,"Did you notice anything unmuncherly about him?"
ON_OVERVIEW_TORPEJO_AREA_5,"That's right"
ON_OVERVIEW_TORPEJO_AREA_6,"He's just pretending to be a Muncher"
ON_OVERVIEW_TORPEJO_AREA_7,"This guy must be stopped"

ON_OVERVIEW_SOLIDUDE_AREA_1,"That stone is completely stuck in that solid cube"
ON_OVERVIEW_SOLIDUDE_AREA_2,"They must be a real solid dude"
ON_OVERVIEW_SOLIDUDE_AREA_3,"I'm sure that tube is lubed for a rude..."
ON_OVERVIEW_SOLIDUDE_AREA_4,"Cylindrical figure"
ON_OVERVIEW_SOLIDUDE_AREA_5,"Ya better rescue that poor Solidude"
