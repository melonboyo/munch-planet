Big Mode Game Jam game by GOFROG GAMES.

Theme is "mode".

## Critter Guy Game (tentative title: Munchmee World)
3D Action game. Online multiplayer.
There are challenges that you cannot overcome! But there are little critter guys roaming around making funny noises (munchmees).
Munch one up to add it to your collection! They squirm a bit, and that's okay. (like kakunte tribe from moon)

_Gameplay loop_
- You grab a munchmee and eat it. You get to name it and see its stats.
- Buy food at the shop for your munchmee, or trade with a kind muncher fellow.
- Manage your munchemes in your stomach (they have beds and television). 
- Pitch your munchmes in fights against other munchers' munchmees.
- Go on adventures with your munchmees and solve puzzles, unlock new gadgets, and have a whole ton of fun.
- Some gadgets are illegal. The munchopolice WILL get you.
- You can team up with other munchers in your quests or battles with other munchers.
- You can trade munchmees with other munchers.

## MODES
### Overworld MODE
Mode where you walk around and explore.

Here you should be able to:
- Open manage mode.
- Enter catch mode when close enough to a wild munchme.
- Enter interact mode if in possession at least one munchme and close enough to a point of interactivity.
- Interact with NPCs (dialog).
- Emote.

### Catch MODE
Mode when you attempt to catch a munchme.

Here you should be able to:
- Play a minigame against the munchme you are trying to catch.
- Win and obtain the munchme and exit to overworld mode.
- Or lose and exit to overworld mode where the munchme will sprint away.

### Manage MODE
Mode where you manage the health and mood of your munchmes.

Here you should be able to:
- Monitor the stats of your munchmes including health, mood and sleep.
- Feed your munchmes.
- Give gifts to your munchmes.
- Play with your munchmes, such as poking them or tossing them around.
- There should also be a version only for looking for when you wanna see someone else's munchmes.

### Interact/Deploy MODE
Mode where you interact with something using a chosen munchme.

Here you should be able to:
- Choose a munchme to send out.
- Walk around in a designated area close to the interation point as your chosen munchme.
- Use your munchme's powers.

Possibilities:
- You can deploy your munchme anywhere and get a window to control it when focused on it. You can control yourself as well clicking off the window.

  This would give a whole lot of freedom which might turn out confusing/hard to do level design for/too unruly. Could allow multiple munchmes but would need a way not to clutter the screen.
- The main camera switches to the deployed munchme and either you follow it around automatically or stay in place.

  This would mean you can't deploy multiple munchmes and you can't control the player character at the same time. It would make the gameplay more focused and limited for game design while allowing some freedom.
- You interact with a specific point and the main camera switches to the deployed munchme and you can only move around in a designated area around that point.
  
  This would reduce freedom but allows for very focused puzzle/level design.

### Fight MODE
Mode where you fight a player/non-player enemy using your munchmes (may be the same as interact mode).
