Big Mode Game Jam game by GOFROG GAMES.

Theme is "mode".

## IDEAS
- Animorphs type beat.
- Change mode through little power-ups. But those power-ups are little critter guys running around, and that's kinda sad.
- Change to roll mode, then not.
- Cooking game where you go kill some guys to cook.

## Critter Guy Game
3D Action game. Online multiplayer.
There are challenges that you cannot overcome! But there are little critter guys roaming around making funny noises.
Eat one to gain a cool power! They squirm a bit, and that's okay. (like kakunte tribe from moon)


_Gameplay loop_
You grab a critter and eat it. You get to name it and see its stats.
That's it.
